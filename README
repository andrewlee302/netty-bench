Because Netty flush the message asynchronously, so we can't measure the transfer time only by the end of sender's flush time.
The time transfer is based the interval between start send the first message and receive the last message.

messageNum = 5000
flushNum = 1
threadNum: 1~8
messageSizeInKB: 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512

Notice: When the size of message increse up to 256K or even 512K and the messageNum is 5000, the rate for transferring become much slowly. Further more, if the product of message size and threadNum exceeds 512K, the receiver seems to block when receive the data. The reason is unknown.

Some test failed, as follows:
threadNum messageSizeInKB
#1	512 much slowly
2	256 much slowly
#2	512 much slowly
4	128 ok
4	256 much slowly
#4	512 much slowly
8	64  ok
8	128 ok
8	256 much slowly
#8	512 much slowly

So in the next tests, the parameters should set as follows:
messageNum = 5000
flushNum = 1
threadNum: 1~8
messageSizeInKB: 1 2 4 8 32 65 128
